# GAME PLAY //Still template text
Use the game play section to create a descriptive paragraph about how the game is played. You want the use tor imagine
they are actually playing the game. Try not to use generic (i.e., broad, non-descriptive) terms when writing about the game
play. For example, few readers want to hear statements such as, “enemy_1 will have more hit points than
enemy_2.” Instead, it’s better to make statements like, “The Lazarus Fighter has more armour than the Apollo Fighter.”

## Game Play Outline //Still template text
This outline will vary depending on the type of game.
- Game options

- Story synopsis

- Game elements

- Game levels

- Player’s controls

- Winning

# DESIGN DOCUMENT //Still template text
This document describes how GameObjects behave, how they’re controlled and their properties. This is often referred to as
the “mechanics” of the game. This documentation is primarily concerned with
the game itself. This part of the document is meant to be modular, meaning you could have
several different Game Design Documents attached to the Concept Document.

## Design Guidelines //Still template text
This is an important statement about any creative restrictions that need to be considered and includes brief statements
about the general (i.e., overall) goal of the design.

## Game Design Definitions //Still template text
This section established the definition of the game play. Definitions should include how a player wins, loses, transitions
between levels, and the main focus of the gameplay.

## Game Flowchart //Still template text
The game flowchart provides a visual of how the different game elements and their properties interact. Game flowcharts
should represent Objects, Properties, and Actions present in the game. Each of these items should have a number reference
to where they exist within the game mechanics document.
- Menu
- Synopsis
- Game Play
- Player Control
- Game Over (Winning and Losing

## Player Definition //Still template text
- Use this section for quick descriptions that define the player
- Use the Player Properties section (below) to define the properties for each player. Player Properties can be
  affected by the player’s action or interaction with other game elements. Define the properties and how they affect
  the player’s current game.
- Use the Player Rewards section to make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way. Define these
  objects by describing what affect they cause and how the player can use the object.

## Player Definitions //Still template text
A suggested list may include:
- Health
- Weapons
- Actions

## Player Properties
### Statistics
- Strength: Scaling for Strength based actions and ----
    - (Example: Attacking with a greatsword, moving a builder)
- Dexterity: Scaling for Dexterity based actions and ----
    - (Example: Attacking for daggers, dodging a trap)
- Endurance: How far the player can go without resting and eating, increases health, carry capacity
    - (Example: Low endurance makes the player take more damage, unable to carry more items)
- Attunement: Scaling for Magic based actions and the max amount of Mana
    - (Example: )
- Faith: Scaling for
    - (Example: )
- Wisdom: Scaling for
    - (Example: )

### Feat

### Skills

## Player Rewards (power-ups and pick-ups)
Money, to buy new gear and survival equipment, potions, etc.  
Experience points, to level up and increase stats, gain new feats and skills  
Monster corpses, to sell for money or consumption within dungeons

## User Interface (UI) //Still template text
This is where you’ll include a description of the user’s control of the game. Think about which buttons on a device would be
best suited for the game. Consider what the worst layout is, then ask yourself if your UI is it still playable. A visual
representation can be added where you relate the physical controls to the actions in the game. When designing the UI, it may
be valuable to research quality control and user interface (UI) design information.
