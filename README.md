This is just a game project that I'm working on
Inspired by the Etrian games, such as Etrian Mystery Dungeon, Etrian Odyssey, etc.

Written in Kotlin for Android using Android Studio
I initially wanted to write the game in C++, but available game engines such as Unreal Engine or Unity, were just too much clutter for what I wanted to achieve

Unreal Engine 5, does not support my phone and is biased for high quality graphics
Unity would have used C#, but it would add too much clutter for my goals
Godot is using its own language which I'm not familiar with
Android Studio does support C++ implementation, but it was too confusing
(Android Studio "C++ Game Activity" also doesn't support my phone)

So I had to settle with Kotlin for this project
